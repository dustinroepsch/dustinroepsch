# Microsoft (Summer 2018) #

While I was an intern at Microsoft I worked on adding support for suggesting features through the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/idea/post.html).

I learned a lot about Typescript, Riot.js, and C# throughout the process

# Google (Spring 2018) #

At Google, I worked on the backend for the [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace)

Google has a whole host of internal tools and frameworks that I interacted with during my time there. Some of the more externally recognizable tools I used are Java, Python, Protocol Buffers, Guice, Guava, Autovalue,gRPC, and AngularJS.

# Microsoft (Summer 2017) #

My first internship at Microsoft I worked for the Outlook team on the windows desktop client. This was my first experience on a large codebase. My internship was spent interacting with a large, heavily concurrent C++ codebase. I also interacted with Microsoft COM objects and learned how C++ and C can interropt with eachother.

# Rockwell Collins (Spring and Summer 2016) #

While at Rockwell Collins I worked in a manufacturing environment on multiple projects. Most of these projects were done using Microsoft Access, with a little bit of Python and some Sikuli sprinkled in for good measure.

# Source Allies (Summer 2015) #

Source Allies was my first internship, right after freshman year at Iowa State University. I learned an incredible amount through this experience. I had never done any web development before, but during this internship I was tasked with learning React and building a single page application used by the HR team. By virtue of being my first internship, this is by far the most I've learned in an internship, walking away with knowledge in Javascript, React, Liquibase, Tomcat, Bootstrap, Material Design Lite, Spring Framework, and SQL.
