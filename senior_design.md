# ISEAGE Traffic Generator #

My senior design project is to create a configurable, scalable web traffic generator that will be used in a cyber defence competition environment as well as a classroom setting.

# Cyber Defence Competition #

The CDC at Iowa State is composed of three teams:

* Blue Team: Students that have created web services according to the contest specification. This team wants to keep these services up and running for as long as possible, while keeping the contents of the servers safe and secure from the red team.

* Red Team:  Industry Professionals / ISU Faculty that are attempting to break and/or gain access the Blue team servers.

* Green Team: Volunteers that verify that the services provided by the blue team are functioning properly.

However, the Green team isn't always sending traffic to every server owned by the blue teams. Because of this, the blue team can assume that any traffic they recieve is malicious traffic, and can act accordingly.

By creating a configurable tool that can generate network traffic, we will obscure the ip address' of every team, making a blanket IP ban much less useful, as it would be hard to ensure that you aren't accidentally banning the green team.

# Role #

My role on the team is `Quality Assurance`. It is my job to make sure everyone is participating fully in the code review process. Additonally, I am tasked with keeping our version control clean, and in general making sure good dev practices are being followed.
