# Purpose #

My portfolio is my way of showing you all of the things I've accomplished during my time at Iowa State university. This includes projects I have done, classes I have taken, and internship experiences I have had.

# Career Objective #

I will be joining Google in August 2019. I plan on using my time there to learn from some of the best engineers in the world, and grow as a software developer.
