# Purpose #

My portfolio is my way of showing you all of the things I've accomplished during my time at Iowa State university. This includes projects I have done, classes I have taken, and internship experiences I have had.

# Career Objective #

I enjoy creating tools and libraries, and as such I will be joining Google Cloud Platform in August 2019. I look forward to helping the team at Google make excellent API's and tools for developers to accomplish great things.

In the future I'm interested in delving into compilers / lanugages as a whole. I'm interested in the ways a language can influence how a developer thinks. Programmers follow the path of least resistence, and I'm excited about the ways a programming language can influence that resistence. By making good choices the easiest choice, a language is able to guide a programmer into making faster, safer software.
