## General Education Reflection ##

# Short Term Goals #

I have accepted a job at Google, so my most immediate goal is to graduate. After I graduate, I will move to Seattle, Washington where I will work on the Google Cloud Platform team. I'm extremely excited for the opportunity to work on widely used development tools and API's. I know I will learn a lot from the experience.

# General Electives #

General Electives at Iowa State force you to take a break from the Math and Science aspects of engineering, and instead focus on becoming a more well rounded individual.

For Example, while at Iowa State I took a political science course (Pol S 315). During this course, I learned that even with an extremely accurate machine that could determine whether or not a person is a terrorist with a high degree of accuracy, we would still be very uncertain that the person was a terrorist if the machine's alarm went off. This is because the overwhelming majority of people are not terrorists, and since the odds of being a terrorist are so incredibly low, our accurate machine going off still isn't a sure sign that the person is a terrorist due to bayes law.

I also took women's studies 325 (Portrayals of Gender in the Media) this class was very different than other classes I've taken at Iowa State, because it spent a lot of time reflecting on video and audio. In my engineering classes we spend a lot of time learning how to design things or the physical properties of the world, so it was nice to have a class that was focused on reviewing less concrete material.

This result shows how much size and scale matter when thinking about a problem. It seems counter intuitive that an accurate machine would have a high rate of false positives, which is why it's important to look at data analytically when making engineering decisions.

# ISU Preparation #

Iowa State has prepared me to solve engineering problems by having me work on simplified engineering problems during computer engineering labs and project classes. For example, in Cpre288 we program a roomba to be remotely controlled from a seperate room without a video feed. This type of restraint is common in the real world, so being forced to create a program that is useable remotely was an excellent learning experience.

Iowa State also forces you to work on group projects. Com Sci 309 is a good experience, because it makes you realize how hard coordinating a team of people is. Writing software in parallel with other people is difficult, especially when that software is being built from the ground up so there is no common base that everyone can begin branching their work from. This forced me to learn tools like Git, Trello, and the Agile process to organize development on a team.

Programming is inherently self taught to some degree. Watching lectures or youtube videos will only take you so far, but the last mile will always be accomplished by writing software hands on. During my time at Iowa State I took advantage of online resources such as Youtube, Stackoverflow, Hackernews, and Reddit to gain suplemental material related to the coursework I was doing, but by far the best way I solidified my knowledge was by using the coursework in my personal projects.

The career fair at Iowa State is an excelling resource. My first two internships were acquired there, and without those internships I'm not sure I would be employeed currently. I think it's great that ISU pushes freshman to go to the career fair. Without the career fair I probably would not have had an internship the summer of my freshman year, as I would have thought it wasn't worth spending the time applying. By being forced to go the career fair, I found out that there were companies interested in me, and my experience has snowballed from there.
